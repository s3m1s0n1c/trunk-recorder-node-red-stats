This is a Node-Red Dashboard for Trunk-Recorder calls via @Taclane's [trunk-recorder-mqtt-status](https://github.com/taclane/trunk-recorder-mqtt-status) plugin

Trunk-Recorder sends stats to MQTT Broker Server via plugin
Node-Red connects to MQTT Broker Server and displays stats on Dashboard


* Import Json file into Node-Red

* Change IP of MQTT Broker
  
* Change Topic in 'MQTT' node to reflect correct topic you are sending in mqtt plugin
