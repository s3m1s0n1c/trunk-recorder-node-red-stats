A Node-Red Dashboard for Trunk-Recorder calls via MQTT

This project is fork of @Taclane's [trunk-recorder-mqtt-node](https://github.com/taclane/trunk-recorder-mqtt-node) which recieves MQTT Data sent from Trunk-Recorder via @Taclane's [trunk-recorder-mqtt-status](https://github.com/taclane/trunk-recorder-mqtt-status) plugin to a MQTT Server

I have added my own twist on it and added a few other functions onto it.

Setup information is in the [Wiki](https://github.com/s3m1s0n1c/trunk-recorder-node-red-stats/wiki)

See [images](https://github.com/s3m1s0n1c/trunk-recorder-node-red-stats/images) folder for examples of each tab on the dashboard.
